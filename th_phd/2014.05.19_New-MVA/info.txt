The task is to retrain MVAs for jet assignment and classification. The code is mostly copied from 2014.02.24_Full-analysis/Step1_MVA. An important change is that forward jets are treated differently: a larger pt threshold is used there, and pseudorapidity is considered in wide bins only. This is implemented in a hacked version of PECFwk: modified-forward-jets@8317ebbca34faf749c28e06fbd2c15a851dbe045.

Another major change is that I use an optimised set of observables provided by Afiq (excluding mismodelled ones).

Use tHbb package of version master@5e03511cbca37d416bb7a2680e31c0e51ad3784a.


=== tHq ===

Compared to 2014.02.24_Full-analysis, now the recoil jet is chosen among untagged jets only. A bug in RecoTHInputVarsPlugin::ChooseElements has been fixed. Training is performed with events with (eventID.eventNumber % 25) <= 5 (as in 2014.02.24_Full-analysis/Step1_MVA/thq).


=== ttbar ===

Now jets matched to b-quark jets from top decays are searched among b-tagged jets only (true for ~95% of all events that pass the selection). Training is performed with events with (eventID.eventNumber % 25) <= 7 (as in 2014.02.24_Full-analysis/Step1_MVA/ttbar).


=== Class ===

After the tuples are split into training and examining sets with the splitTuples program, all tuples in each of the two sets are merged with hadd.

Three NNs are prepared. They have different sets of inputs:
 a) the optimised set by Afiq, but without the sphericity and with jet pseudorapidity instead of rapidity;
 b) the old set without mismodelled variables (sphericity, s-hat, cos(theta*));
 c) the old set as is.

ROCs obtained for cases a and b are virtually indistinguishable.
