I use same same observables as in 2014.02.24_Full-analysis/Step1_MVA/thq, excluding PassBTag_Recoil and Cos_LepRecoil_TH. The former one is unnecesary because now only untagged jets are matched to the recoil quark in the permutations. The second observable is quite discriminative but is mismodelled, and thus cannot be used.

The complete list:
  Mass_Higgs
  Mass_BTopLep
  Eta_Recoil
  PassBTag_BTop
  NumBTag_Higgs
  DeltaR_BJetsHiggs
  DeltaR_BTopW
  DeltaR_TopHiggs
  RelHt
  MaxEta_BHiggs
  MinPt_BHiggs
  Charge_BTop
